# Hi! I'm @soc-oi
I'm a high school student interested in math and computer science.

I work most with Node.js (socket.io and discord.js) and Python. I am familiar and able to work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite. I'm looking into working with Lua as well ðŸ‘€

I have developed multiple Discord bots for personal use and web scrappers for educational purposes.
